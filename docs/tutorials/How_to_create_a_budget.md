# How to create a budget

In this tutorial we will go through the steps of making a budget by yourself.
A template for a budget can be found under `docs/templates`

There are many ways to make one, and this tutorial just goes over the basics for a personal monthly / yearly budget.

Normally I like to make clear divisions for myself in the following factors:
- is this a necessary subcategory
- how much tax is this subcategory
- is this expense / income periodical  
- is this a monthly or yearly expense


## Income
For the income, usually the money comes periodically.
I like to always identify the following:
    - jobs
    - allowance
    - gifts
    - others

for each of these categories, I write down the date (if known) and the tax amount (if necessary)

## Spendings
Spendings are divisible in 2 groups, periodical and eratic.
Also for each sub category, I like to take note if this is a necessary spending, or something that's nice to have.
Making this distinction explicitly makes cutting costs later on a lot easier.

Under periodical spendings, I usually like to put the following subcategories:
    - subscriptions
    - hairdresser
    - rent
    - insurance
    - public transport
    - banking costs

Under eratic spendings, I usually like to put the following categories:
    - food
    - transport
    - housing
    - education
    - appearance
    - utilities
    - hobbies
    - appliances
    - gifts
    - parties

Off course these categories and sub categories are different for everyone.

## Total and Differences
Finally it's then time to calculate the totals and the difference.
If the budget is already off, decisions need to be made what to do to make it fit.

Solutions are:
    - earning more money through side jobs
    - cutting all non-essential costs
    - take out a loan

## Loans and Savings



## Taxes
